# System Workflow

The system processes pacemaker signals through the following pipeline:

1️⃣ Pacemaker device generates heart signals  
2️⃣ Signals are streamed through a data pipeline  
3️⃣ LSTM model analyzes the signal patterns  
4️⃣ Abnormal heart rhythms are detected  
5️⃣ Alerts are generated for anomalies  
6️⃣ Results are displayed in the real-time monitoring dashboard
